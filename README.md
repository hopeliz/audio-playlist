# Audio Playlist
Version 1.13

This code creates an audio playlist. It was developed to work in Blackboard for Ohio University's History of Rock Course.

## Disclaimer
The code housed on Github is to be used as a backup by the relevant Ohio University employees only (including the Office of Instructional Innovation).

## Prerequisite
This was optimized for Blackboard Learn (the version being used as of 2015 at Ohio University).

## Instructions
I. Set up

In the file, audio.js:

1. Replace the "Playlist Title" with the title of the playlist.
2. Replace the "PutDirectLinkHere.mp3" with the direct link to the audio files. They MUST end with .mp3.
3. Replace the "Title of Song" with the title of the corresponding song.
4. Replace the "Artist of Song" with the artist of the corresponding song. Note: The order of songs should correspond with the order of titles, artists, and composers.
5. Replace the "Composer of Song" with the composer of the corresponding song. If there is no composer, type "none". 
6. If more songs are added, each line should end with a comma (outside of the quotes) EXCEPT the final line.
7. Save the file. Note: playlist.html can be embedded in an iframe as well.
